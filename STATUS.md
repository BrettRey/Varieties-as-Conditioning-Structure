# STATUS: Varieties as Conditioning Structure

**Stage:** Seed / exploratory notes
**Created:** 2026-01-20

## What This Is

HPC-Bayesian framework for discourse community, register, and dialect as conditioning structure in a probabilistic model of construction choice.

Core insight: the three variety types differ only in *what you condition on* and *how stable that conditioning is across situations and speakers*.

## Current State

- `notes.md`: Comprehensive capture of informal + formal definitions, Bayesian formalisation, realism assessment, modelling options

## Likely Trajectory

1. HPC book section (Part III or IV on dynamics/emergence)
2. Possible standalone paper if the framework proves generative

## Connections

- English_LBC_functionalist (opportunity sets, posterior predictive)
- Grammaticality_de_idealized (normativity as conditioning)
- Labels_to_Stabilisers (how labels stabilise distributions)
- HPC book (varieties as cluster kinds)
